# Spectral-clustering-from-scratch
When I studied spectral clustering for the first time, I was AMAZED!! This was the first thing where I used Eigenvectors instead of just calculating. I have used Initials of my name and graduation year to create some data points in this assignment. End result in the clusters shown in different colors.
